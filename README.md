# Bitwarden_RS
This project is an unofficial implementation of the [Bitwarden Core Server](https://github.com/bitwarden/core) written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

*(Note: This project is not associated with the [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) project nor 8bit Solutions LLC.)*

# Build/Run
This project can be built and deployed in two ways:

## Docker Setup (Easy)
Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to your system and then, from the project root, run:
```sh
# Build the docker image:
docker build -t bitwarden_rs .

# Run the docker image with a docker volume:
docker run --name bitwarden_rs -t --rm -v bw_data:/data -p 80:80 bitwarden_rs
```
Then visit [http://localhost:80](http://localhost:80)

## Manual Setup (Advanced)
### Dependencies
- `Rust nightly` (strongly recommended to use [rustup](https://rustup.rs/))
- `OpenSSL` (should be available in path, install through your system's package manager or use the [prebuilt binaries](https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Binaries))
- `NodeJS` (required to build the web-vault, (install through your system's package manager or use the [prebuilt binaries](https://nodejs.org/en/download/))

### Install the web-vault
Download the latest official release from the [releases page](https://github.com/bitwarden/web/releases) and extract it.

Modify `web-vault/settings.Production.json` to look like this:
```json
{
  "appSettings": {
    "apiUri": "/api",
    "identityUri": "/identity",
    "iconsUri": "/icons",
    "stripeKey": "",
    "braintreeKey": ""
  }
}
```

Then, run the following from the `web-vault` directory:
```sh
npm install
npx gulp dist:selfHosted
```

Finally copy the contents of the `web-vault/dist` folder into the `bitwarden_rs/web-vault` folder.

### Running
```sh
cargo run
```
Then visit [http://localhost:80](http://localhost:80)

# Configuration
The available configuration options are documented in the default `.env` file, and they can be modified by uncommenting the desired options in that file or by setting their respective environment variables.

Note: the environment variables override the values set in the `.env` file.

## Disabling user registrations
To disable user registrations, you can uncomment the `SIGNUPS_ALLOWED` line in the `.env` file and change the value to `false`.

You could also set the `SIGNUPS_ALLOWED` environment variable. To do that when using Docker, add the following line to the end of the `docker run` command:
```
-e SIGNUPS_ALLOWED=false
```

## Changing the API request size limit

By default the API calls are limited to 10MB. This should be sufficient for most cases, however if you want to support large imports, this might be limiting you. On the other hand you might want to limit the request size to something smaller than that to prevent API abuse and possible DOS attack, especially if running with limited resources.

To set the limit, you can use the `ROCKET_LIMITS` variable. Example here shows 10MB limit for posted json in the body (this is the default):
```
-e ROCKET_LIMITS={json=10485760}
```

## Enabling HTTPS
To enable HTTPS, you need to configure the `ROCKET_TLS` option, the same way as `SIGNUPS_ALLOWED`.

The values to the option must follow the format:
```
ROCKET_TLS={certs="/path/to/certs.pem",key="/path/to/key.pem"}
```
Where:
- certs: a path to a certificate chain in PEM format
- key: a path to a private key file in PEM format for the certificate in certs

## How to recreate database schemas (for developers)
Install diesel-cli with cargo:
```sh
cargo install diesel_cli --no-default-features --features sqlite-bundled
```

Make sure that the correct path to the database is in the `.env` file.

If you want to modify the schemas, create a new migration with:
```
diesel migration generate <name>
```

Modify the *.sql files, making sure that any changes are reverted in the down.sql file.

Apply the migrations and save the generated schemas as follows:
```sh
diesel migration redo

# This step should be done automatically when using diesel-cli > 1.3.0
# diesel print-schema > src/db/schema.rs
```

## Backing up your Vault
The official bitwarden backup documentation can be found here:
https://help.bitwarden.com/article/backup-on-premise/

There are 3 folders that need to be backed up in the official install. In the bitwarden_rs install, the default docker setting will have all 3 of these folders in same location: /data/.
Backing up this one folder will backup your sqlite database, key files and attachments. 

Note that the official bitwarden install uses a MySQL database which is automatically backed up nightly. This is not the case with the bitwarden_rs. Instead you should use a backup program to create incremental backups.
